Demo
------
Works best with two computers (or screens), with one representing citizen and the other representing the support rep.

1. Open [http://rishihahs.github.io/iris-client/trial.html](http://rishihahs.github.io/iris-client/trial.html) on the citizen computer.
2. Open the help desk, [http://rishihahs.github.io/iris-client](http://rishihahs.github.io/iris-client) on the support rep computer.
3. On the citizen computer, click 'Citizen Support' to start the chat and co-browsing
4. Click the link that appeared in the help desk on the support rep computer

You can now chat, see the other person's mouse moving, click links (e.g. the menu), fill out text fields (e.g. the search bars at the top)
